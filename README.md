# Peak Performance

Our application allows managers to simply track their employeeâ€™s goals, measures and performance on a weekly basis.  Managers will utilize existing templates, with the option of customizing, to individually score each employee on a scale of: below expectations, meets expectations, exceeds expectations.  Managers will have a required text box for each question to briefly explain why the selected option/score was given.  

## Features

- Managers can complete regular reviews in a matter of minutes on multiple employees
- Managers can run reports on individual or multiple employees
- Managers can choose periods of time in which to pull data
- Access to real-time data for tracking
- Simplifies mid-year and annual reviews = time savings
- Easy to read charts and graphs
- Free
